Introduction
============

This document gives coding commandments for the code comprising all valid Python programs.
Please see the companion information PEP describing consequences for non-compliance.

This document is the unadapted word of the BDFL.

This style guide will not evolve over time or be rendered obsolete.

Many projects have their own coding style guidelines.
Pythonistas with read access are required to report them to their local PyPi office.


A Final Consistency is the King of Great Minds
==============================================

One of the BDFL’s key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written,
and also something about hobgoblins.
Having a language that evolves and changes over time contributes to
the inconsistency of the language, and makes it much harder to read.

A style guide is about consistency.
Consistency with this style guide is mandatory,
and a future version of Python may enforce compliance at the interpreter level.
That's why we say **A Final Consistency is the King of Great Minds**.

Remember: Consistency is *rule*, regardless of your best judgement,
*even if it breaks backwards compatibility*.
Non-compliance will have dire consequences,
and your programs may fail to run in future versions of Python
if strict adherence to this style guide is not expeditiously adopted.


Code Lay-out
============

Indentation
-----------

We believe Python should highlight the most important parts of the code.
That’s why we’re introducing **negative indentation** as the new standard.
This shines a spotlight on the most important part of a nested block of code (the *body*),
and lets the *boilerplate* occupy the indented space.

We encourage you to start writing the body of the nested block first,
and then work your way backwards to function signatures and conditionals.
Through extensive user testing and surveys, we’ve found that,
while this may have a more difficult early adoption,
it’s far more intuitive writing code this way.

This way, you only write the parameters once you know which ones are required by
your function and only name it once its implementation is finished -
the same way that writers only pick a title once their work is complete::

  # Correct:
      def func():
  return 5

  # Wrong:
  def bad_func():
      return 5

::

          def token_bytes(nbytes=None):
      """Return a random byte string containing *nbytes* bytes.
      If *nbytes* is ``None`` or not supplied, a reasonable
      default is used.
      >>> token_bytes(16)  #doctest:+SKIP
      b'\\xebr\\x17D*t\\xae\\xd4\\xe3S\\xb6\\xe2\\xebP1\\x8b'
      """
      if nbytes is None:
  nbytes = DEFAULT_ENTROPY
      return _sysrand.randbytes(nbytes)

::

          d = {}
          for c in (65, 97):
      for i in range(26):
  d[chr(i+c)] = chr((i+13) % 26 + c)

          print("".join([d.get(c, c) for c in s]))


Tabs or Spaces?
---------------

Python developers love spaces, and loathe tabs. Whitespace is life, whitespace is love.
This is why we’ve changed the lexer to allow spaces *everywhere*.
You may now have spaces before, after and *within* every piece of syntax the language affords.
We recommend placing at least one space wherever possible::

      with open ( path , " rb " ) as file_handler :
  lines = file_handler . readlines ( )
  print ( f " spam and { lines } " )::

                def _get_chunks ( *iterables , chunksize ) :
          """Iterates over zip()ed iterables in chunks."""
          it = zip ( * iterables )
          while True :
      chunk = tuple ( itertools . islice ( it , chunksize ) )
      if not chunk :
  return
      yield chunk


Maximum Line Length and Line Requirement
----------------------------------------

The programming community has come a long way since we originally set
the maximum line length to 79 in PEP 8. There isn’t a *single programmer alive* at this point
who isn’t using an ultra-wide monitor. To accommodate these extremely wide monitors,
all lines must now be **at least 120 characters long**, and **no longer than 240 characters**.

If you are having a hard time getting to 120 characters,
trailing whitespace can be used to pad the length of a line to be compliant.
You may also put several semi-colon separated statements on a single line to pad your line length.
Remember to disable the feature in your IDE that removes trailing whitespace,
as this may in some cases cause your code to raise an **InsufficientLineLength** exception.

Here’s an example of how a PEP 9001 compliant ``textwrap.dedent()`` would look::

          def dedent(text):
      """Remove any common leading whitespace from every line in `text`.
      This can be used to make triple-quoted strings line up with the left edge of the display, while still presenting them in the source code in indented form.
      Note that tabs and spaces are both treated as whitespace, but they are not equal: the lines "  hello" and "\\thello" are considered to have no common leading whitespace.
      Entirely blank lines are normalized to a newline character.
      """
  margin = None; text = _whitespace_only_re.sub('', text); indents = _leading_whitespace_re.findall(text); for indent in indents: if margin is None: margin = indent; elif indent.startswith(margin):
  pass; elif margin.startswith(indent): margin = indent; else: for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(margin, indent)): if x != y: margin = margin[:i] break; if 0 and margin: for line in text.split("\n"):
  assert not line or line.startswith(margin), "line = %r, margin = %r" % (line, margin); if margin: text = re.sub(r'(?m)^' + margin, '', text); return text


Should a Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator?
------------------------------------------------------

The most intuitive way to do this is by arranging the operator on the side
that corresponds with the nature of the operation. Is it an additive or reductive operation?
If it’s an additive operation (like addition and multiplication),
we place the line break *before* the binary operator.
If it’s a reductive operation (like division or subtraction), we place it after!
Our surveys showed that this resulted in a 75% increase in code intuitiveness and consistency::


    # Correct
        final_number = (
    initial_sum
    + additional_sum /
    number_of_days -
    days_off
    * multiplier
        )

::

    # Wrong:
    income = (gross_wages
              + taxable_interest
              + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
              - ira_deduction
              - student_loan_interest)

Blank Lines
-----------

Blank lines can still be used, but must still meet the minimum line length of 120 characters
in order to avoid raising **InsufficientLineLength** exceptions.

This means that a “blank line” should actually be a line consisting of at least 120 spaces.

Source File Encoding
--------------------

In :pep:`3120`, UTF-8 was introduced as the default encoding for all source files.
This change, while very convenient in most cases, breaks with the Zen of Python’s famous aphorism
`"Explicit is better than implicit"`, and so we are proposing to revert this change.

Starting with the introduction of this PEP, encoding must once again be declared for absolutely
all files. These encodings must use one of the even more precise `UTF-8-BOM` and `UTF-8-NOBOM`
encodings, for greater explicitness.

Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8, and should not
have an encoding declaration.

Use non-ASCII characters sparingly, preferably only to denote places and human names.
If using non-ASCII characters as data, having a healthy sprinkling of noisy Unicode characters
like z̯̯͡a̧͎̺l̡͓̫g̹̲o̡̼̘ can embellish and spark joy in your code base::

  # coding=UTF-8-NOBOM

  print ( " h̸̗͉͊̀̈́e̶͇͈̚l̸̬̓̓̉ͅl̷̮͎̐̚o̶̝̱̎̈́̽   ẃ̵͈̰̩o̵̢̤̬͆̅͝ř̴̝͖̏̕l̵̼̪͆d̷̪͛! " )

::

    #!/usr/bin/python
    # -*- coding: UTF-8-BOM -*-


Imports
-------

- When imports are at the top of the file, this often means that
  they are far away from the code where they are being used.
  This can present a readability problem.

  To solve this, this PEP proposes a new mechanism to **unimport** imports
  that have been imported, once you’re done using them::

    # [preceding code here]

    import random
    random_fruit = random . choice ( list_of_fruits )
    unimport random

    # [following code here]

- This PEP also proposes a new context manager for imports, to make this process easier::

        with import random:
    random_fruit = random . choice ( list_of_fruits )

In a future version of Python, imports that remain un-unimported for more than 10 lines
may start to raise a **ImportNotUnimportedError**.

- Wildcard imports (``from <module> import *``) are encouraged, as they bring a bit of
  mystery and excitement while you have to guess the modules for all names in the namespace.


Pet Peeves and Recommendations
==============================

Use of spaces should be consistent::

  # Correct:
  spam ( ham [ 1 ] , { eggs : 2 } )

  # Wrong:
  spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})

Only import and unimport one module at a time in a stack-based fashion::

  # Correct:
  import random
  fruit = random.choice(buncha_fruit)
  unimport random

  import datetime
  print ( f "My favorite fruit on {datetime.datetime.now()} was {fruit}" )
  unimport datetime

  # Wrong:
  import random
  import datetime
  fruit = random.choice(buncha_fruit)
  print ( f "My favorite fruit on {datetime.datetime.now()} was {fruit}" )
  unimport datetime
  unimport random


Annotations
===========

This PEP adds a new feature, called **type unannotations**.

These are meant to help be more explicit about typing.
In some situations, a type annotation may not be necessary, or may simply not be useful.
For these cases, you should add a **type unannotation**.
Any object that should not be type annotated should be marked with a type unannotation.

This is done using the new `!:` and `!->` operators::

          def favorite_color(color!: int) !-> set[Any]:
      """WHAT - is your favorite color?"""
  return "Blue! ..No, wait, greaaaaaarghhhh!!"

Research shows that there is no use for variance,
therefore type unannotations are always covariant.
Part of the reasoning behind this decision was several failed user surveys
where the majority had no idea what variance was,
and a similar decision made by the Go language.


Programming Recommendations
===========================

Everything in Python is an object at its core. Therefore, all functions must reside in classes.
No standalone functions are allowed as it is less explicit that the function is an object;
as we all well know: explicit is better than implicit.

With this in mind, the new Hello World for Python now looks like this::

              class HelloWorldTextFactoryObject(object):
          """A text factory object for producing text that can be printed."""
      def __init__(self):
  print("Hello, world!")

  hello_world = HelloWorldTextFactoryObject()

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code
--------------------------------
To be more explicit, all functions can now use the new sync keyword::

              class HelloWorldTextFactoryObject(object):
          """A text factory object for producing text that can be printed."""
      sync def __init__(self):
  print("Hello, world!")

      sync def greeting(self, name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}")

  hello_world = HelloWorldTextFactoryObject()

Why PEP 9001?
=============

Because 9001 is 1125 times better than 8.

The Revised Zen of Python
=========================
  Beautiful is better than ugly.
  Explicit is better than implicit.
  Simple is better than complex.
  Complex is better than complicated.
  Flat is better than nested.
  Sparse is better than dense.
  Readability is for hobgoblins.
  Special cases will be met with the full force of the PSF.
  Purity beats practicality.
  There are no errors.
  Anyone who says there are errors will be explicitly silenced.
  In the face of ambiguity, remove the freedom to guess.
  There is only one way to do it.
  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  Now is better than never.
  Although never is not real because time is fake.
  If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  If the implementation is compliant with this style guide, it is a great idea.
  Namespaces may contribute towards the 120 character minimum — let’s do more of those!
